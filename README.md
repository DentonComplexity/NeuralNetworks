# NeuralNetworks
This repository should contain code relating to simulating networks of neurons.

langevin.f90 is a Fortran file for simulating a 2D lattice of neurons using the leaky integrate-and-fire model with random initial voltage after firing.

mfield.f90 simulates the same model on an all-to-all network of neurons.
